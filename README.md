Enhancing E-commerce Product Information Accuracy by Comparing Machine Learning Algorithms

In this project, I enhanced the accuracy of E-commerce product information by comparing various machine learning algorithms, including BERT, Random Forest, CNN, Word2Vec, and SVM. By evaluating the performance of these algorithms, I identified the most effective models for improving product data accuracy in E-commerce platforms.
